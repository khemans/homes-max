The core "vibe" is one of friendly discovery and transparent guidance, leveraging low-code/no-code platforms for rapid development and an excellent user experience.

## 5. Features & Functionality

### 5.1. Home Page / Entry Point

- **Design:** Light-hearted, clean, visually appealing (earthy tones, light blues, warm neutrals, cheerful pops).
- **Hero Section:**
  - Headline: "Your Home's Diary: Uncover its past stories."
  - Sub-headline: "Your friendly guide to permits, property rights, and peace of mind."
  - Search Bar (Prominent): Large, central input field.
    - Placeholder Text: "Ask me anything about a property's past (e.g., '123 Main St permits', '23 Oak Ave history')" â€“ Critical for AI/NLP readiness.
    - Input Type: Supports natural language queries, parsed to extract address and keywords.
  - Call to Action Button: "Uncover Story" / "Reveal Diary."
  - Illustration: Whimsical, stylized home/diary/book motif.
- **"What You'll Discover" Section:**
  - Three distinct, visually appealing sections outlining core offerings: "Permit Pages," "Property Rights Chapter," "Sensitive Stories & Disclosures."
  - Each with a relevant icon and brief, reassuring description.

### 5.2. Search Results / Property Details Page (MVP Concept)

- **Logic:** Upon submitting a query, the system parses the address and keywords. Since direct API lookups for all data types are challenging with public data, the initial MVP will focus on providing structured guidance based on the query.
- **Structure:**
  - **Property Identified:** Display the identified address prominently (e.g., "Exploring the story of 123 Main St, Anytown, USA").
  - **Information Sections (Dynamically Displayed based on query and/or always present):**
    - **"Permit Pages" Section:**
      - Friendly introduction to permits.
      - Actionable Guidance: Clear, step-by-step instructions on how to find permits (e.g., "1. Identify your local county/city planning department. 2. Visit their official website (we'll provide common links here). 3. Use their property search tool. 4. Look for 'building permits', 'code enforcement records'").
      - External Links: Curated links to common county/city government websites (e.g., "Search for [Your County Name] building permits"). Initial version will likely require manual lookup by user.
      - Vibe: Empowering, clear, step-by-step.
    - **"Property Rights Chapter" Section:**
      - Friendly introduction to property rights (mineral, water, air, easements).
      - Key Explanations: Simple, jargon-free definitions of each right.
      - Actionable Guidance: Instructions on how to find this information in a property deed or county records (e.g., "Your property deed outlines these rights. Here's how to access it...").
      - Vibe: Informative, demystifying, educational.
    - **"Sensitive Stories & Disclosures" Section:**
      - Introduction to the sensitive nature of this information and privacy laws.
      - Legal Context: General overview of typical disclosure laws for real estate agents regarding deaths (state-by-state variations).
      - Guidance: What questions a homebuyer can ask their agent and when an agent must disclose.
      - Vibe: Respectful, informative, responsible, avoids sensationalism.
      - Disclaimer: Explicitly state that "Your Home's Diary" does not access private death records.

### 5.3. Disclaimers & Footer

- Clear disclaimers that the information provided is guidance and educational, not legal advice, and users should always verify with official sources and legal professionals.
- Standard footer: Contact (placeholder), Privacy Policy (placeholder), Terms of Service (placeholder).

## 6. Technical Requirements (Low-Code/No-Code Focus)

- **Platform (Recommended for MVP):** Webflow (for front-end design, content management, static pages) + potential integrations for more advanced features.
- **Alternative/Future Consideration:** Bubble (for more complex app logic, user accounts, internal databases if needed).
- **Search Functionality:**
  - Address Parsing: Utilize a service (e.g., Google Maps API integrated via low-code connector like Zapier/Make, or a built-in platform feature) to validate and standardize address input.
  - Keyword Parsing: Simple keyword extraction from the natural language input to determine user intent (e.g., "permits," "deaths," "rights").
- **Content Management:** Easy to update and add new guidance articles, definitions, and external links without code.
- **Responsiveness:** Fully functional and visually appealing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
- **Performance:** Fast loading times for a smooth user experience.
- **Scalability (Future):** Ability to expand features and handle increased traffic without significant re-platforming.

## 7. User Experience (UX) & Design

- **Aesthetics:** Aligned with the chosen color palette (earthy, light blues, warm neutrals, cheerful pops). Clean, uncluttered layout.
- **Tone:** Friendly, approachable, empathetic, knowledgeable.
- **Navigation:** Intuitive and straightforward.
- **Readability:** Clear fonts, appropriate line spacing, concise paragraphs.
- **Visual Elements:** Consistent use of custom illustrations and icons to reinforce the "vibe" and aid understanding.

## 8. Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

- User Accounts: Allow users to save properties, track research.
- "My Diary" Feature: Personalized dashboards for saved properties.
- Integration with Public APIs (if available): Direct pulls for some permit data if reliable, public, and free/affordable APIs emerge.

- Community Forum/Q&A: Allow users to share insights or ask questions.
- Geolocation: Suggest relevant local government links based on the entered address's location.
